# **Unicorn Companies - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  

## **Introduction**  
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) report and a Colab notebook focused on unicorn companiesâ€”startups valued at $1 billion or more. The analysis is designed to provide insights into factors influencing unicorn success, funding trends, geographical distribution, and industry dominance.  

The report and notebook demonstrate key skills in data cleaning, visualization, and the application of the DIKW (Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom) framework to generate actionable insights.

## **Key Insights**  
The analysis highlights significant trends in the unicorn ecosystem:  
1. **Valuation Trends**: Most unicorns hover around the $1 billion mark, with only a few exceeding $4 billion.  
2. **Funding Patterns**: Successful unicorns typically raise between $0.1B and $0.5B.  
3. **Industry Dominance**: Fintech, Internet Software & Services, and AI lead the unicorn industry.  
4. **Geographic Distribution**: North America dominates, followed by Asia and Europe. Africa and South America lag significantly.  
5. **Top Countries**: The U.S. leads in unicorns, followed by China and India. Emerging players include Brazil and Singapore.  
6. **Growth Over Time**: A sharp rise in unicorns occurred post-2019, with a peak in 2021.  
7. **Top Investors**: Accel, Andreessen Horowitz, and Tiger Global are the leading unicorn investors.  
8. **Industry Funding Range**: E-commerce and Fintech sectors show the most variability in funding.  
9. **Continent-Industry Matrix**: North America leads across most industries, followed by Asia in select sectors.
